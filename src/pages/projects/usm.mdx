# Background

I work at the University Learning Center, New York University's free
peer-tutoring organization. In my work as a Learning Assistant there, I end up
seeing a lot of students, largely looking for help with Computer Science, Math,
and Writing. However, that is far from all we do at the ULC. The ULC offers a
multitude of courses, the extent of which can be seen on our
[website](https://www.nyu.edu/ulc). To offer the variety we do, we have a staff
of around 60 people (and growing!)[^1]

Our directors have the unenviable task of making our schedules, from
availability we send over, and then figuring out what times each class is
available, to put on the website. This process is both slow, and error-prone. We
noticed that, despite our best efforts, there were always issues with the
schedule on the website.

That is where the idea of the schedule maker was born. We aimed to automate this
process, and we decided to do it through making a web app.

# Features

Unlike most university computer science projects, we knew we'd actually have
users. We began by considering what our directors would actually want in this
sort of tool. The main idea was to import the Google Calendar crafted by the
directors, and spit out something that could go on the website, but there were
complexities abound.

We thought about a few things initially, and added things along the way[^2]:

1. **Google Auth:** We would require Google login through OAuth, so that we can
   fetch the calendar info. We'd also require auth on our end to make sure that
   only our directors could access functionality.

2. **Binning Algorithm:** The events we get from the calendar are centered
   around tutors, and their availability. Since our tutors teach a lot of
   different courses, we would need to change this focus, and bin according to
   course instead. To do this we needed to create an algorithm that would do
   these transformations for us, and merge overlapping events.

3. **Support for multiple locations:** The ULC operates in multiple locations
   across campus, so we needed to make sure that we were creating a product that
   spits out different schedules for the different locations.

4. **Source of truth:** We needed some canonical list of courses the ULC would
   support, but required flexibility if someone wanted to tutor a course that
   wasn't on that list.

5. **Class information import:** One thing our directors really disliked doing
   was manually updating the aforementioned course list with the correct
   information: the course ID, canonical name, department, etc. We needed a way
   to minimize their frustration.

6. **Good UX:** The last thing we needed was for the users of our application to
   ask us how to use it. We wanted to make the product as intuitive as possible.
   This also meant having good documentation for our users, so that need to come
   to us less. Finally, this meant good error messaging. Errors are bound to
   happen with an app of this complexity, and bad errors are endlessly
   frustrating.

# Stack Considerations

Beginning this project, we had a few considerations in mind. Our development
team was small, just three CS tutors, and we'd have limited time to work on the
project (we had to juggle schoolwork, work at the ULC, and now this). Therefore,
we needed a stack we were all fairly comfortable with.

After much deliberation, we landed on the classic **MERN
([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/),
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)) stack, with
Next as our meta-framework for React**. We considered using Django, for its
integrated auth, database, and default admin pages. However, our onboarding time
would be considerable, and we'd have to use Python, a language none of us are
super into.

We were all into the idea of a strongly typed language, and the idea of sharing
types across the backend and frontend was very compelling. That's why we ended
up standardizing on TypeScript for the whole project, using type-safe React,
type-safe Express, and even type-safe database calls.

This idea, as it turns out, has been becoming more and more popular in the web
dev space, and a lot of work is going into better tooling and developer
experiences in the area. Had I known about some of these projects, like
[tRPC](https://trpc.io/), and
[Next's great API support](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), I
think I would've pushed for us to use them; they look magical.

# Implementation

Implementing the schedule maker took a lot longer than we had expected,
especially as the scope of the project grew. We began by pair programming a lot.
While fun and largely productive, we knew we'd need to parallelize to make the
most of our limited time. Keeping both the frontend and backend in lock-step,
however, was a challenge. Often one of us would be working on a feature without
knowing how it would plug in to the rest of the project.

This isolated work pattern forced us to get creative. Here, we used TypeScript
to our advantage. Every week, our first order of business was to figure out the
types associated with the feature we were to build, along with any API routes,
and the types of requests and responses associated with them. A concrete
understanding of these types allowed us to split off and work separately without
having to worry about whether it would fit together without breaking.

This led to us developing very rapidly, and also had the knock-on effect of
being better documented than any of my previous projects. The
[type documentation](https://github.com/ulcnyu/ulc-schedule-maker-v2/blob/b3b8eeb3fb87fa714f6fa12590b2a620a626be90/docs/types.md)
and
[API documentation](https://github.com/ulcnyu/ulc-schedule-maker-v2/blob/b3b8eeb3fb87fa714f6fa12590b2a620a626be90/docs/api.md)
we ended up with is some of the best I've seen for a small project like this.

With that overall approach, we tackled the features we wanted to implement:

1. **Google Auth:** Because we were using express, we relied on
   [passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication, despite its
   admittedly lackluster documentation, which caused me many a headache. We
   stored auth info both on the session, and in our MongoDB database, which we
   were hosting on [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas), their quick and easy
   way to get a database running on the cloud. It has been working great for us.

2. **Binning Algorithm:** The binning algorithm was reminiscent of classic
   scheduling algorithms taught in an algorithms course. Its design involved a
   lot of whiteboarding, and even more types. We had to deal with
   inconsistencies in the parsing of events from Google Calendar, leading to
   some very annoying edge cases (one especially infuriating one was the use of
   em dashes instead of en dashes, which messed with our parser.)

3. **Support for multiple locations:** This was largely a UI problem. Our UI had
   to be intuitive enough to support multiple locations, which was somewhat
   difficult to do, but was managed by relying on modern responsive CSS tech
   (largely flexboxes and grids.)

4. **Source of truth & class information import:** Prior to this project, the
   closest semblance we had to a source of truth was a half broken Google Sheet
   that contained some class information. It had been manually added to over
   years, and was very difficult to work with. Sanitizing that data would not
   have been fun.

   Ideally, we would have liked to get course information straight from NYU.
   However, after trying and failing multiple times to get access to NYU's class
   API, we gave up on the idea. Instead, we used
   [Schedge](https://github.com/A1Liu/schedge), a really nice API created by an
   NYU alum, with information he scraped from the NYU course search site.

   This ended up also solving the class information import problem: we now had
   access to every single course taught at NYU, which we had put into our
   database, from the Schedge API.

5. **Good UX:** This was very much a process. None of us are designers, and we
   were somewhat out of our depth. However, we ended up with something that I
   believe is perfectly usable, and even looks pretty nice (thanks to
   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), which I absolutely adore.)

# Results

We ended up with a product that I am fairly proud of. It solves a specific
problem that we faced, and sped up the creation of the schedule for the website,
freeing time for our directors to work on things that are more important.

[^1]:
    The return from COVID has been massive for us, and our staff has ballooned;
    the ULC has never been more busy. Turns out students didn't quite like
    online pedagogy. Who knew!

[^2]:
    Yay, scope creep! We did try to keep this to a minimum (I've been bitten by
    scope creep too many times to count), but some still made its way in.
